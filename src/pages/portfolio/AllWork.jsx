                        Students were tasked with designing a new, unique VR application (hereby referred to as “system”).
                        The designed application should make uniquecontribution to existing research and/or state-of-the-art.

                    <p>
                        Students were tasked with writing a report where they describe the system and contrast it to existing
                        work, describe design decisions informed by existing research, and describe how the system is used.

                        VR Aided Architecture and Interior Design has many design/planning applications in the real world.
                        The generalidea behind this concept is to allow architects and their customers to accurately visualize a sense of the buildings scale,
                        mood, and space before anything is actually constructed...

                    Students had to make a persona made up attributes, encompassing various behaviours,

                    This is a mobile application that was made in Justin’s 3A term of his undergraduate study.
                    The task was to create a mobile application that solves the 2020 RSA Design Brief #3: Hybrid Home/Work.

                    This is the app that Justin took part of throughout the design creation and prototyping process.
                    Flex is a mobile auto-scheduling application with the help oif an in app assistant.

                    For you as a user and myself a UX designer it is vital to understand the creation process of these mobile applications.

                <p>
                    Below is our proposed solution. Our task for this mobile application was to redesign UW
                    Learn which is the University of Waterloo’s platform used for online learning.

                <p>
                    One of our main solutions to improve online communication was to implement a direct messaging feature for students
                    and for professors. Thus allowing both parties to stay ion touch providing an easier tool for communication
